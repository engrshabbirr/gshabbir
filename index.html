            <h2> Who Am I</h2>
            <p>
                I am electrical engineer-cum-freelancer finding challenges to test my skills. My professional development can be categorized into two broader classes: Electronics Engineering and Data Science. Since the skill-set in Data Science like statistics and machine learning are the research supporting areas in electrical engineering, so it has become an integral part of my professional growth.
            </p>

            <p><strong>ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING</strong></p>
            My core education is in electronics, the core of electrical engineering. Electronics itself is broader field of engineering, so, I could develop following skills in some areas of electronics:

            <p> <strong> a) Analog Circuit Design</strong></p>
            <p>Given a design problem which might require the development of a circuit containing passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors) and active components (discrete: diode, transistors, thyristors etc; ICs like op-amp, 555 Timers etc), I can design a functional prototype. Since I cannot deliver hardware, so this service will involve the provision of soft prototypes only. These prototypes can be delivered in SPICE-based tools like NI Multisim, LTspice, PSPice and PSIM.</p>

            <p><strong> b) Control System Design</strong></p>
            <p>This is one of my favorite area of electronics. Given a control problem, I can design various types of controllers beginning from classical controller like PID to most advanced controller like fuzzy-logic controller (FLC). Other controller which I can design are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC)</li>
                <li>Loop Shaping Control</li>
                <li>Sliding Mode Control (SMC)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I can design all these controllers in MATLAB and their simulation results are provided in Simulink. If someone needs the simulation to be accomplished in NI LabVIEW, they can also be provided.</p>

            <p><strong> DATA SCIENCE (DS)</strong></p>

            <p>This one is the most favorite skill-set for me. Since it lets me have fun with my research and professional activities. Data science is majorly based on stastics and machine learning and heavily aided from linear algebra. Although many other areas like artificial inteligence, soft-computing can be considered as contributing to data science. My mjor skills in Data Science come from Machine Learning (ML) and Statistics</p>

            <p><strong>a) Machine Learning</strong></p>
            Given some ML problem, I can deliver the job according as my client's requirements. The problem might fit to one of TWO MAJOR machine learning problems: Regression and Classification. The delivered job will have comprehensive details as it will be passed through ML cycle to train and achieve the best possible model. These jobs will be delivered using MATLAB. C++ code can also be delivered if needed.

            <p><strong> b) Statistics</strong></p>
            <p>Major support for DS is provided from statistics. The majors in statistics can be listed as Measures of Central Tendency, Measures of Dispersion and Hypothesis Testing. I have developed skillful grip on all these things.</p>
